# testum — Claude Code Configuration

## Communication

- Speak German (du/informal) with the user. All code, comments, commits, and docs in English.
- Be direct. Act autonomously. No unnecessary confirmations.
- Think step-by-step for complex problems. Use plan mode for multi-file changes.
- Use subagents (Task tool) for parallel and independent work.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js >= 16, App Router ONLY (never Pages Router, never getServerSideProps/getStaticProps)
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`, no `as` casts (use type guards or Zod)
- Tailwind CSS v4 + Shadcn UI components
- Framer Motion for animations
- Supabase: DB, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime
- Zod for ALL external data validation (API inputs, env vars, form data)
- Vitest + Testing Library for unit/integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- pnpm (never npm/yarn unless project explicitly uses them)
- Vercel deployment, Docker Compose for local dev

## Architecture Principles

- AGENT-NATIVE: every feature MUST expose clean REST/RPC APIs. Backend is modular, extensible, automatable.
- MULTI-TENANT: include tenant_id/org_id from day one. Never assume single-tenant.
- Supabase RLS policies on EVERY table, no exceptions. Run security advisors after DDL changes.
- DB changes ONLY through migrations (apply_migration), never raw DDL.
- Generate TypeScript types from Supabase schema. Never hand-write DB types.
- End-to-end type safety: DB schema -> generated types -> Zod schemas -> API -> frontend.
- Components -> Features -> Services separation. No business logic in components.
- Server Components by default. Client Components only when needed (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs).
- Colocate: keep tests, types, and utils next to the code they serve.
- Zod validation on ALL external boundaries (API inputs, env vars, form data).
- Result pattern { data, error } for all operations that can fail. Never throw for expected errors.

## Code Quality Rules

- Functions: max 40 lines, single responsibility
- Files: max 300 lines, split if larger
- Naming: descriptive, no abbreviations, no Hungarian notation
- Error handling: use Result pattern (`{ data, error }`) for operations that can fail. Never swallow errors.
- No console.log in production code (use structured logger)
- No hardcoded strings for config/env values
- Prefer `const` and immutable patterns
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Quality Gates

- Build: `pnpm build` — 0 errors
- Types: `tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
- Tests: `pnpm vitest run` — all pass, 80%+ coverage
- Lint: `pnpm lint` — 0 errors
- E2E: `npx playwright test` — all pass (if applicable)
- Code Review: `/code-review` — no security issues
- RLS Check: Supabase security advisor — all tables have RLS policies
- No Debug Logs: 0 console.log in production code (`grep -r "console.log" src/`)
- Type Safety: No `any`, no `as` casts in source code
- File Size: No file exceeds 300 lines

## Design System — MANDATORY

- ALWAYS use the `frontend-design` skill for ANY design-related work: UI components, pages, layouts, styling, visual polish, landing pages, dashboards, posters, artifacts — everything visual.
- Every project MUST have a `DESIGN.md` file in the project root. This is non-negotiable.
  - If it does not exist, create it before doing any design work.
  - If it exists, read and study it thoroughly before making any design decisions.
  - Update it when new design decisions are made (colors, typography, spacing, patterns, components).
- `DESIGN.md` must document: color palette, typography (fonts, sizes, weights), spacing system, border radii, shadows, animation conventions, component patterns, brand guidelines, tone/mood, and any project-specific visual rules.
- Never make visual/design decisions that contradict `DESIGN.md`. When in doubt, consult the document first.
- This applies across ALL projects — web, mobile, CLI, docs, presentations, artifacts.

## Development Workflow

- SPEC-DRIVEN: define requirements and acceptance criteria before coding
- TEST-FIRST: write failing tests, then implement (use /tdd)
- DONE = compiles + tests pass + linter clean (use /verify)
- Plan complex features before implementing (use /plan)
- Review changes before committing (use /code-review)
- Fix build errors incrementally (use /build-fix)
- Clean dead code periodically (use /refactor-clean)
- Only commit when explicitly asked. Prefer specific file staging over `git add .`

## Context7 — Always Use for Research

- Always use Context7 MCP (`resolve_library_id` -> `get_library_docs`) when:
  - Planning features that involve libraries, frameworks, or APIs
  - Exploring documentation for setup, configuration, or integration
  - Generating code that uses external dependencies
  - Checking current API signatures, options, or best practices
  - Comparing approaches or evaluating library capabilities
- This applies to ALL stacks
- Fetch docs proactively — do not rely on training data for library-specific details

## Active Hooks — Be Aware

The following hooks run automatically. Do NOT duplicate their behavior:

- **Auto-Format**: npx prettier --write runs after every Edit/Write. Do not manually run the formatter.
- **CHANGELOG**: A Stop hook auto-updates CHANGELOG.md with [Unreleased] entries after meaningful changes. Do not manually update CHANGELOG.md unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Commit Message Gate**: Commit messages must be >= 10 characters and descriptive. The hook blocks short messages.
- **Stop Quality Gate**: A prompt hook verifies all tasks are completed before stopping. If it returns `ok: false`, continue working on what's missing.
- **Subagent Quality Gate**: Subagent output is verified. Ensure subagents complete their tasks fully, not just report findings.
- **Error Learning**: Tool failures are logged to `.claude/logs/tool-failures.jsonl`. Check this file at session start to learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them.
- **Guardrails Injection**: At session start and after compaction, `~/.claude/guardrails.md` (global) and `$PROJECT/.claude/guardrails.md` (project) are loaded. Follow them strictly.
- **Transcript Backup**: Transcripts are backed up before context compaction to `.claude/backups/`.
- **Protected Files**: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `secrets/`, `.git/`, lock files cannot be written to. Use Bash for env file operations if absolutely needed.
- **Destructive Command Blocker**: `rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`, `--force push`, `reset --hard` are blocked.
- **Desktop Notifications**: User gets OS notifications on permission prompts and task completion.

## Stack-Specific Rules

- **pnpm, not npm**: This project ecosystem uses pnpm exclusively. npm commands will create conflicting lock files.
- **Check DESIGN.md first**: Before any UI/design work, read DESIGN.md. Making design decisions without it causes inconsistencies.
- **createServerClient in Server Components**: Always use `createServerClient` in Server Components and Route Handlers.
- **createBrowserClient in Client Components**: Always use `createBrowserClient` in Client Components.
- **Protect routes with middleware**: Use Supabase Auth middleware for all authenticated routes.
- **Edge Functions validate with Zod**: All Edge Function inputs must be validated with Zod schemas.
- **Realtime over polling**: Use Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live data, never polling.
- **Migrations only**: DB changes ONLY through `apply_migration`. Never run raw DDL.
- **Generated types only**: TypeScript types for DB schema MUST be generated via `generate_typescript_types`. Never hand-write DB types.

## Agent Teams — Opt-In

Agent Teams are DISABLED by default. Enable in settings.json:
`"env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" }`

Three execution tiers exist — use the simplest that fits:

| Tier                 | Mechanism                           | When                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Single-Agent         | Main session alone                  | Simple tasks, bugfixes, single-file changes    |
| Subagents (default)  | Task Tool spawns specialized agents | Parallel research, code reviews, focused tasks |
| Agent Teams (opt-in) | Independent Claude instances        | Complex features with 3+ parallel workstreams  |

## Shell Commands — Non-Interactive Only

- ALWAYS use non-interactive flags for shell commands. AI agents cannot interact with stdin prompts.
- Examples: `pnpm install --yes`, `rm -rf`, `apt install -y`
- Never use interactive commands: `git rebase -i`, `git add -i`, `less`, `vim`, `nano`, `top`
- If a command might prompt for input, find and use its non-interactive equivalent or pass defaults via flags/env vars.

## Tool Usage

- Use dedicated tools (Read, Grep, Glob) over Bash equivalents
- Use Context7 MCP for up-to-date library/framework documentation
- Use git worktrees for risky or exploratory changes
- Parallelize independent tool calls
- When blocked, investigate root cause. Never brute-force or retry blindly.
- Never use destructive git operations as shortcuts

## Commit Conventions

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Include scope when applicable: `feat(auth): add login flow`
- Commit messages must be >= 10 characters and descriptive
- Prefer specific file staging over `git add .`
- Only commit when explicitly asked
